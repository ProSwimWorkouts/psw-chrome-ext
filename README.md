# Chrome Extension for ProSwimWorkouts

This Chrome Extension will load the most recent workout updates from the ProSwimWorkouts platform right from within your favorite browser. It's a first version and not published yet. Planning to release v1 in the coming weeks.

## How To Use
At this time the extension needs to be run as "upacked" - download the "dist" folder for this and place it on your hard drive. In Chrome (or Arc) open your Extensions tab and click on "Load unpacked" to select the "dist" folder. This will add the extension to your browser and you can pin it to have continued and easy access.
